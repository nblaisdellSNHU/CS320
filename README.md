### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By employing the skills we've learned in this class and the reading material provided, using techniques like black- and white-box testing, and using known testing libraries, such as JUnit, to test the code that we write, hopefully before we even implement our code. By doing so, we'll ensure that the code we write going forward will continue to work as we intend, as well an ensuring that the requirements for the software are being met.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The way I interpret a user's needs and incorporate them into a program is first attempting to map their need onto the set of data elements that will be stored in the program. From there, I can ask more specific questions to get more details about how that data might be stored and used throughout the application/software. Once a certain amount of information is obtained from the user, the developer can expand on how it might be implemented, as long as they make sure the end result is matching the requirement put forth by the original user.

### How do I approach designing software?
After coming up with an idea, creating a concrete set of requirements encapsulating all of the things required to make the idea a reality is a vital step to make sure any work done on the project is in pursuit of one of these requirements, so that no extra unneccessary work is done. From there, testing our code and ensuring that each of those tests correspond in some way to those set of requirements will make sure that the design of the software is soudn.
